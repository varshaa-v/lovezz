  <h2>Heyy Bhuviii 🖤</h2>
  <p>
It’s Varshh, writing to you,
Because Valentine’s felt incomplete without these words.
So before anything else, let me ask you this, bby!
Will you be my Valentine? 💋
Even when days pass without us sharing time,
My heart never forgets where it belongs.
I miss you more than I can explain,
And still, I choose you—today, tomorrow, always.
No matter who walks into my life, or where life takes us,
You are the one my soul holds onto forever.
You know it… and I hope your heart whispers the same truth back to mine.<br>
So here’s my heart, wrapped in this little letter, 
Not just for Valentine’s Day,
But for every day I want you by my side,
Now, always, and for a lifetime. ❤️<br>
    In the quiet of dark nights,<br>
    where words fail and hearts speak,<br>
    you exist —<br>
    not loudly,<br>
    but deeply.
  </p>

  <p>
    If love had a shade,<br>
    it wouldn’t be bright,<br>
    it would be calm,<br>
    like this moment,<br>
    like you.
  </p>

  <p>— Varsh</p>
